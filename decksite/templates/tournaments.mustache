        <h2>{{_ Other Notes}}</h2>
        <p>{{_ If a player starts a sideboarded game with less than 60 cards (quite possible due to a known Magic Online bug) and either player notices before the end of turn 2 and either player wants to restart the game, the game will be restarted. The result of any game played beyond turn 2 with less than 60 cards in maindeck will stand.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Matches should use 25 minute timers.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ A player may not play games under more than one account in a Penny Dreadful tournament.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Please do not double queue Penny Dreadful tournaments with other tournaments nor double queue in the league.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Only players completing the tournament will be awarded prizes.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Because of a [bug](https://github.com/PennyDreadfulMTG/modo-bugs/issues/308) removing all stops is not allowed.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ You may only enter a given tournament once (either on the same account or multiple accounts).}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Penny Dreadful tournaments follow official Magic Online tournament rules and do not allow draws, unlike some other player-run events.}}</p>
